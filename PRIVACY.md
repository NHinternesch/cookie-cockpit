# Privacy Policy — Cookie Cockpit

**Last updated:** 2025-02-13

## Overview

Cookie Cockpit is a browser extension for inspecting, editing, creating, and deleting cookies. It is designed to operate entirely within your browser. No data is collected, stored, or transmitted to any external server.

## What Data Is Accessed

Cookie Cockpit accesses the following data solely to provide its functionality:

- **Cookies** — The extension reads, creates, modifies, and deletes cookies for websites you visit. This is the core purpose of the extension.
- **Page domains** — The extension reads the URL and title of the active tab to identify which site's cookies to display and to discover resource domains loaded by the page.
- **Tab screenshots** — The extension captures a screenshot of the active tab to display a visual preview in the dashboard. The screenshot is used only for display within the extension and is never stored or transmitted.

## Data Processing

All data processing happens **locally in your browser**. Specifically:

- No data is sent to any external server.
- No data is stored outside of the browser's local extension runtime.
- No cookies or browsing data is logged, cached, or persisted by the extension.
- No analytics, telemetry, or tracking of any kind is included.
