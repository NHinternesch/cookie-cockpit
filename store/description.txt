KEY FEATURES

● Live Cookie Dashboard
View all cookies for the current site in a clean, sortable table. See cookie name, value, domain, path, expiration, size, and flags (Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite) at a glance.

● Real-Time Monitoring
Watch cookies change in real time. Cookie Cockpit highlights new, modified, and deleted cookies as they happen — no manual refresh needed.

● Domain Discovery
Automatically identifies all resource domains loaded by the page (first-party and third-party), so you can see exactly where cookies are coming from.

● Vendor Identification
Recognizes cookies from known tracking vendors, ad networks, analytics providers, and other third-party services, helping you understand who is setting cookies and why.

● Smart Filtering & Search
Filter cookies by domain, name, or value. Toggle between first-party and third-party views. Quickly find the cookie you're looking for.

● Cookie Editing
Edit any cookie value, expiration, domain, path, or flags directly from the dashboard. Changes take effect immediately.

● Cookie Creation
Create new cookies from scratch with full control over all attributes.

● Cookie Deletion
Delete individual cookies or clear all cookies for a domain with one click.

● Visual Site Preview
See a screenshot of the active tab alongside the cookie data for quick visual context.

PRIVACY FIRST

Cookie Cockpit processes everything locally in your browser. No data is collected, stored, or sent to any external server. There are no analytics, no tracking, and no third-party services. Your browsing data stays on your machine.

WHY THESE PERMISSIONS?

Cookie Cockpit requires the following permissions to function:

• "cookies" — Core functionality: the extension needs to read, create, edit, and delete cookies.
• "tabs" — Used to capture a screenshot of the active tab and to read the tab's URL and title.
• "scripting" — Used to inject a small script that discovers all resource domains loaded on the page.
• "Access to all websites" — A cookie manager needs to work on any website you visit, not just a predefined list.

BUILT FOR DEVELOPERS & POWER USERS

Cookie Cockpit is designed to be fast, lightweight, and distraction-free. It uses no external libraries and runs entirely as a Manifest V3 Chrome extension with a minimal footprint.
