Edit any cookie value, expiration, domain, path, or flags directly from the dashboard. Changes take effect immediately. Create new cookies from scratch with custom attributes. Delete individual cookies or clear all cookies for a domain with one click.

PRIVACY FIRST

Cookie Cockpit processes everything locally in your browser. No data is collected, stored, or sent to any external server. There are no analytics, no tracking, and no third-party services. Your browsing data stays on your machine.

WHY THE PERMISSIONS?

Cookie Cockpit requires the following permissions to function:

• "cookies" — Core functionality: the extension needs to read, create, edit, and delete cookies.
• "tabs" — Used to capture a screenshot of the active tab and to read the tab's URL and title.
• "scripting" — Used to inject a small script that discovers all resource domains loaded on the page.
• "Access to all websites" — A cookie manager needs to work on any website you visit, not just a predefined list.

BUILT FOR DEVELOPERS & POWER USERS

Cookie Cockpit is designed to be fast, lightweight, and distraction-free. It uses no external libraries and runs entirely as a Manifest V3 Chrome extension with a minimal footprint.
