Chrome Web Store — Permissions Justification
=============================================
Paste each section into the corresponding field in the Chrome Web Store
developer dashboard under "Privacy" → "Permissions justification".


Permission: cookies
-------------------
Cookie Cockpit is a cookie management tool. The "cookies" permission is
required for its core functionality: reading all cookies for the current
site, creating new cookies, editing existing cookie values and attributes
(domain, path, expiration, Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite), and deleting
cookies. Without this permission the extension cannot function.


Permission: tabs
----------------
The "tabs" permission is used for two purposes:
1. Reading the active tab's URL and title to determine which site the user
   is viewing, so the extension can display the correct cookies.
2. Capturing a screenshot of the active tab (via chrome.tabs.captureVisibleTab)
   to show a visual preview of the site in the cookie dashboard.


Permission: scripting
---------------------
The "scripting" permission is used to inject a small content script into
the active tab. This script discovers all resource domains loaded by the
page (e.g., script sources, image sources, iframe origins) so the extension
can show the user which first-party and third-party domains are setting
cookies. The script only reads DOM attributes and does not modify the page.


Host permission: <all_urls>
---------------------------
Cookie Cockpit is a general-purpose cookie manager that must work on any
website the user visits. The "<all_urls>" host permission is required
because:
1. The chrome.cookies API requires host permissions for the domains whose
   cookies are being accessed.
2. The scripting API requires host permissions to inject the domain
   discovery script.
3. Users expect a cookie manager to work on every site, not a predefined
   list of domains.
This permission is not used to collect or transmit any user data.
