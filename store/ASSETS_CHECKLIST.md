# Chrome Web Store — Assets Checklist

Use this checklist when preparing visual assets for the Chrome Web Store listing.

## Required

- [ ] **Extension icon (128x128 px)**
  - Already exists: `icons/icon128.png`
  - Used as the store listing icon

- [ ] **Screenshots (1280x800 or 640x400 px)**
  - At least 1 required, up to 5 allowed
  - JPEG or PNG, no alpha
  - Suggested screenshots:
    1. Main dashboard showing cookie table with cookies loaded
    2. Live monitoring feed with cookie changes highlighted
    3. Cookie detail / edit view
    4. Domain discovery / third-party vendor identification
    5. Cookie creation dialog

## Recommended (Optional)

- [ ] **Small promo tile (440x280 px)**
  - Displayed in the Chrome Web Store browse/search results
  - Should include the extension name and a clean visual

- [ ] **Marquee promo tile (1400x560 px)**
  - Used for featured placement in the Chrome Web Store
  - Higher-resolution promotional image

## Tips

- Use clean, high-contrast screenshots that clearly show the extension UI
- Avoid showing personal data or real cookies in screenshots — use a demo site
- Keep text overlays minimal; the screenshots should speak for themselves
- Export as PNG for lossless quality
