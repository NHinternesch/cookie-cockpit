## Key Features

• Live Cookie Dashboard <br>
View all cookies for the current site in a clean list view and advanced detail view.

• Real-Time Monitoring <br>
Watch cookies change in real time. Cookie Cockpit listens to cookie changes and highlights new, modified, and deleted cookies as they happen — no manual refresh needed.

• Vendor Identification <br>
Recognizes cookies from known vendors, ad networks, analytics providers, and other third-party services, helping you understand who is setting cookies and why.

• Smart Filtering & Search <br>
Filter, sort, and search cookies by domain, name, or value.

• Cookie Creation, Editing, Deletion <br>
Edit any cookie value, expiration, domain, path, or flags directly from the dashboard. Changes take effect immediately. Create new cookies from scratch with custom attributes. Delete individual cookies or clear all cookies for a domain with one click.

## Privacy First

Cookie Cockpit processes everything locally in your browser. No data is collected, stored, or sent to any external server. There are no analytics, no tracking, and no third-party services. Your browsing data stays on your machine. Cookie Cockpit requires the following permissions to function:

• "cookies" — Core functionality: the extension needs to read, create, edit, and delete cookies

• "tabs" — Used to capture a screenshot of the active tab and to read the tab's URL and title

• "scripting" — Used to inject a small script that discovers all resource domains loaded on the page

• "Access to all websites" — A cookie manager needs to work on any website you visit, not just a predefined list
